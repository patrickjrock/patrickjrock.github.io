    <h1>Wednesday night tomato sauce</h1>
    <i>Four servings</i>
    <br>
    <p>Add <b>1 tablespoon of olive oil</b> to an enameled cast iron pot, and turn the heat to medium until the oil is heated. Remove the casings from <b>5 italian sausages</b>
    and add them to the pot. Allow the sausage to brown for 5 minutes; while it is browning, break it apart with a wooden spoon. After the sausage has some color,
    add <b>one diced onion</b> and cook until it is translucent. Pour in <b>1, 28 oz can of San Marzano tomatoes</b> and deglaze the pot with the juices. Season with:
    <b>1-2 tsp of red pepper flakes</b>, a few grids of <b>black pepper</b>, and a pinch of <b>salt</b>. If they are available, add a spoonful of <b>capers</b>. 
    Allow this to simmer, on medium low, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Consider adding a <b>glug of wine</b> if the sauce needs hydration. Finally, season to taste.</p>
    <p>Cook the pasta (I would reccomend a <b>penne</b> or <b>farfalle</b>) according to box directions, drain, and then stir the noodles into the sauce pot. Usually an entire 16 oz box of pasta will be too much for this amount
    of sauce and will give a suboptimal pasta-to-sauce ratio.</p>
    <p>Serve with freshly grated <b>parmesian</b> or <b>pecorino</b>, and freshly chopped <b>parsley</b>.</p>
