          <h4>Pharmalogic Therapy of BPH</h4>
          Alpha-1 antagonists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsulosin">tamsulosin</a>
          are first line therapy against BPH. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can also be used as second line therapy. Alpha-1 
          antagonists may be discontinued due to hypotension. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-alpha_reductase"> finasteride</a> 
          have the side effect of decreasing libido.

          <h4>Treatment of Atropine Toxicity</h4>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine">Atropine</a> is an anticholinergic which inhibits the parasympathetic system. Atropine
          toxicity causes pupil dilation, tachycardia, flushing, and thirst. Treat atropine overdose with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physostigmine">physiostigmine</a>, which increases the amount of available acetyl choline.

            <h4>Acute Interstitial Nephritis</h4>
            <img class="float-right" src="jpgs/ain.jpg">
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_nephritis">AIN</a>
            arises 1-2 weeks after administration of an antibiotic. It is indicated by a BUN createnine ratio less than 15, signaling intrarenal
            failure. Elevated white count with eosinophilia are also present.  Medications that can cause AIN include:
            <ul> 
              <li>penicillins</li>
              <li>cephalosporins</li>
              <li>sulfonamides</li>
              <li>NSAIDs</li>
              <li>PPIs</li>

          <h4>Treatment of CHF With Osteoporosis</h4>
          Loop diuretics like furosemide should not be used with osteoporosis since they inhibit the reabsorbtion of cations like calcium.
          Loop diuretics work by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl transporter in the thick aescending limb of the loop of henle. Calcium and Magnesium
          reabsorbtion rely on a positive luminal charge created by potassium recycling. Thiazides and ACE inhibitors do not affect calcium 
          levels.

          <h4>Adverse Effects of Polymixin B</h4>
          Polymixin B is an antibiotic effective against gram negatives that acts as a membrane detergent. It can cause: numbness in the extremeties, 
          nephrotoxicity, nystagmus, dizzyness, confusion, and blurred vision.
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Bernard-Soulier Disease</h4>
          Bernard-Souler disease causes abnormal bleeding by stopping platelet aggregation. Dysfunction of the vWF receptor block aggregation,
          causing increased bleeding without elevated PT or PTT. Prolonged PTT is indicative of hemophilia A and prolonged PT is indicative of
          hemophilia B.

        <div class="row">
          <h4>Oogenesis Cell Cycle</h4>
          At birth oocytes are arrested at Prophase 1. After ovulation, the oocyte waits at Metaphase 2 for fertilization. 
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Phase 2 blockers</h4>
          Phase 2 of the cardiac myosite action potential is charactarized by a slow influx of calcium into the cell. This "trigger calcium
          is blocked by calcium channel blockers such as the non-dihydropyridine verapamil. Procainamide is a sodium channel blocker and effects
          phase 0.
        </div>  
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Treatment of Headache</h4>
          First line agents for treatment of migrane headaches are serotonin agonists at 5HT-1D and 5HT-1B. Triptans such as sumitriptan are 
          usually the choice.
        </div>    
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Macrolide Induced Cholestatic Hepatits</h4>
          Cholestatic hepatits is an effect of macrolide toxicity. Use of macrolides with CYP450 inhibitors like itraconazole increases the risk
          of toxicity. These patients will present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Its worth noting that this effect 
          is more common with older macrolides like clarithromycin and uncommon with azithromycin.

          <h4>Middle Cerebral Stroke</h4>
          Middle Cerebral artery injury results in expressive aphasia if Broca's area or sensory aphasia if Werneckie's area. Reading, writing,
          and comprehension can also be damaged.      
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Nevocellular Nevus</h4>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus">Nevus cells</a>, derived from melanocytes, lie within the stratum basalis. The stratum 
          basalis is the most mitotically active region and the source of melanoma.

        <div class="row">
          <h4>Bleeding Gums vWF</h4>
          The most common inherited bleeding disorder is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_disease">von Willebrand's Disease</a>. 
          vWD is an autosomal dominant defficiency of vWF, causing 
          increased bleeding time and increased PTT. Treat with desmopressin => increases vWF

	    <h4>Freshwater Pathogens</h4>
            <img class="float-right" src="jpgs/histolytica.jpg">
            <p><i>Entamoeba Histolytica</i> is a freshwater pathogen that causes bloody diarrhea contining throphozites with RBCs under light microscopy.
            Other freshwater pathogens include <i>Giardia Lambia</i> and <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, however these cause fatty-smelly, and watery diarrhea
            respectively.</p>

	    <h4>Antineoplastics</h4>
	    <img class="float-right" src="images/Cyclophosphamid.svg">
	    <p>Alkylating agents work by crosslinking DNA and interfereing with replication. All drugs in this category cause severe bone marrow
	    supression. Cyclophosphaminde causes hemorrhagic cystitis. Busulfan causes pulmonary fibrosis. Ifosphomide causes bladder toxicity similar to
	    cyclophosphomide. Cyclophosphamide is the modt widely used alkylating agent, it is given as a pro-drug and is metabolised into inactive metabolites and toxic
	    compounds like acrolein (nephrotoxic). Mesna (organosulfur) is used to prevent acrolein toxicity. Nitrosoureas are not cross resistant with
	    other alkylators. They are highly lipid soluble and are therefore indicated for brain tumors due to BBB penetration.</p>
	    <p>Platinum analogs are similar to alkylating agents im their ability to cross-link DNA. They are named with the suffix -platin. They cause
	    renal toxicity and ototoxicity. Cisplatin is 1st generation and has the highest toxicity. Cisplatin and carboplatin are used to treat solid cancers like lung
	    cancer, ovarian, and vladder cancer. Oxaliplatin, 3rd generation, is unique in the platins in that it is used to treat colorectal
	    cancer.</p> 
	    <p>Anitmetabolites can be divided into: anti-folates, pyrimidine analogs, cytidine analogs, and puring analogs. Many antimetabolites have
	    the suffix -bine. Gemcitabine is a relatively new drug that is indicated for pancreatic cancer. Leucovorin, a reduced form of folic acid,
	    is the antidote for MTX, which also has use in therapy with 5FU.
	    MTX can cause hand-foot syndrome, a painful erythema and swelling of hands and feet. 5FU, like cyclophosphamide, is a pro-drug and it is
	    metabolised to FdUMP the active metabolite which forms a covalent bond to thymidylate synthase. F5U is deactivated by a polymorphic enzyme
	    dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Patients with a deficiency in DPD have higher risk of 5FU toxicity.
        </div>
        <div class="row">
	    <h4>Bleeding and Clotting Disorders</h4>
            Heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor through antithrombin III which effects factors II and X. Heparin can be reversed with a
	    protamine sulfate antagonist. ITP is associated with viral respiratory infection.
