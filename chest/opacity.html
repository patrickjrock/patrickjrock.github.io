    <hr>
    
    <p> The brightness or darkness of an object is its <i>opacity</i>. Opacity is determined by the absorbtion 
    or <i>attenuation</i> of the X-ray beam. Structres that are more opaque have a higher attenuation. </p>
    
    We roughly divide the opacity of structures into five levels arranged from lowest to highest attenuation:
      <ul>
        <li>air</li>
        <li>fat</li>
        <li>soft tissue</li>
        <li>bone</li>
        <li>metal</li>
      </ul>
    
    When reading cross sectional imaging we can directly and quantitatively assess the attenuation of structures using 
    <i>Hounsfield Units</i>. In plane radiography, structures are superimposed and there apparent opacity is the result
    of attenuation from all structures in the path of the X-ray beam.
