      <li>What does MPRAGE stand for?</li>
      <li>What is the eponymous name for a distal radius fracture></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Radiology culture</h2>
    Signs, buzzwords, 
    <h2>Measurements</h2>
    Ideally with citations.
    <h2>Pathognomic images</h2>
    Pathognomic images are special cases where the differential diagnosis only contains one item.
