    <h1> How to Take a Case </h1>
    <hr>
      
    Presenting a case in radiology is similar to presenting a patient on rounds. You should follow a structured
    presentation format that gives all of the relevant information about the case and your conclusions in an 
    organized format. When taking a case in radiology you should: describe the modality and clinical context, 
    discuss technical factors, briefly summarize what you believe is the relevant finding, state any pertinent negatives,
    give a short differential diagnosis if possibe, and discuss the management or need for follow up imaging. 
    The way you present a case is more important than your knowledge for the way you are percieved.

      This is a frontal chest radiograph of a 65 year old man with a history of heart transplant
      who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient is rotated slightly to the right with apropriate inspiratory effort.
      There are superimposed reticular and hazy opacities in the periphery of both lungs and bilateral pleural effusions.
      There is no pneumothorax. The most likely consideration is acute CHF exacerbation, however COVID-19 pneumonia is 
      also a less likely possibility.
